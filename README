Hello Sir,

This is Group 14 from the CBD Lab in Information Technology. Our MIS numbers are 111108025, 111108036 and 111108038. 
Our assignment questions are:

Group 14 - Ports binding Extended Attributes: 111108025, 111108036, 111108038
(1) Lists ports to which the tenant has access.
(2) Creates a port on the specified network.
(3) Shows information for the specified port.
(4) Updates the specified port.

As a part of the assignment we were able to complete the first two questions of creating a port and listing all the ports to which the tenant has access to. We are still working on the other two questions and we will upload them as soon as we can.

Thanking you,
Group 14
